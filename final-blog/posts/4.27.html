<h3 id="post-title">User Testing</h3>
<p id="body-text">I realized I never posted the notes I gathered while user testing last week. For version one, I had to be realistic with myself and aim to just make a functional, non-buggy site with the following goals (they seem like low targets, but I compiled this while specifically keeping in mind my technical abilities and end goals of this site):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All of my fonts are loading as they should be.</li>
    <li>My positioning is at least somewhat responsiveâ€”at this point, I didn't have the mobile version coded, but it was important that the site looked how it should on different sized laptop screens.</li>
    <li>Navigation is easy and intuitive; no one gets lost.</li>
    <li>Design is overall clean and cohesive.</li>
    <li>Contact information is easily accessible and visible on almost all pages.</li>
    <li>Images load correctly and hover effects are helpful and effective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p id="body-text">
  With all that in mind, for my first round of user testing, I didn't particularly need to have it looked at by my target audience of design professionals, but just about anyone. I asked four of my friends (who are all Communications Design majors, sophomores and juniors, not in our class) to visit the site, didn't give them any hints or prods in any direction, and watched them navigate while I took notes.</p>
  <p id="body-text">After they felt like they'd seen the site, I asked them questions relating to my above goals and about their impressions in general. I based my questions on this list I compiled ahead of time:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Could you describe the mood of this site in one word?</li>
      <li>How did you decide which page to visit next?</li>
      <li>What's the one thing you remember clearest?</li>
      <li>From visiting this site, do you feel like you know how to contact me?</li>
      <li>Was there ever a moment when you were confused or felt a lack of direction?</li>
      <li>As a tech-savvy young person, you know what it feels like to be frustrated with a site for not doing a simple thing you've come to expect. Did you ever experience that here?</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="body-text">
    Their responses were a good exercise in receiving critique and having to decipher for yourself what's universal feedback that warrants an edit, and what's personal taste that may not benefit the project for a wider audience. There were a few areas where their feedback and answers overlapped and created similar answers to the questions. I focused on overlapping feedback to compile a list of common answers to the above questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Light or young.</li>
      <li>Three of my testers navigated the top menu in order from left to right (Home, Art, Design, and lastly About), and one decided to go straight from the Home tab to Design, because that seemed most interesting to her. She then went to Art because she said she wanted to see more work, and she also visited About last to be thorough.</li>
      <li>All four of my testers mentioned the video on the homepage as most memorable. They also expressed a desire for a clearer link between the background video and the ability to watch the whole video, so if you see it and are interested, you could easily be led to where you can watch the whole thing on a normal video player. I never would've thought of that!</li>
      <li>All four said they did know how to contact me, though two also mentioned that the placement of my email on the bottom right of the pages seemed squeezed in there and not integrated.</li>
      <li>None of them expressed confusion, though one did click a project in a gallery that had a broken link, and 404 pages are always kind of alarming. Three of them also mentioned that the About page's design didn't feel cohesive with the rest of the site's look and feel, especially with the illustration.</li>
      <li>All four of them reported that they expected my name on the left side of the gallery pages to be a link back to the home page, and it wasn't. They said it's pretty common convention now that the title of the site or the logo is a link back to home. Three of them also expressed a little annoyance with the way my name slid onto the gallery pages: they all said something to the effect of it's cool the first time, but gets repetitive when it happens on every page (especially when you just saw it happen on the gallery page, you click on a specific piece, and it happens again on that page).</li>
    </ol>
    <p id="body-text">In addition to that, I took notes on their behavoir on the site, and came up with a few little discrepencies between what I'd hoped they'd do and what they actually did (this list is compiled over all four):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The animation on the home page of the orange circle behind my name kicks in too slow, and a lot of them had already nagivated away by the time it kicked in and missed it completely.</li>
      <li>My title font didn't load on their computers! It's my first time trying to use @fontface, so I need to go back and make sure I did it right.</li>
      <li>Apparently a lot of my pages scrolled super far to the right; a few of them realized this and tried to scroll over there to see more content, but obviously there's nothing else there.</li>
      <li>A really good sign was that they all scrolled through the galleries in the way I was hoping they would! They all scrolled through the whole page, hovered over images that caught their eyes, and then scrolled back up to click on specific pieces (they seemed to guess that clicking would lead them to another page, and wanted to make sure they weren't missing anything on the gallery page before navigating away).</li>
      <li>Some of them tried to click on images in the gallery outside of the hover caption, which revealed that the link to that piece's page is actually only on the caption and not the whole image itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p id="body-text">My feedback and notes gave me a really clear direction forward! For version two, I'll actually be showing design professionals, so I'm glad I caught little fixes like these with other students first (saves me a little bit of embarassment!). For version two, I've updated my goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have the mobile version of the site be equally accessible, non-buggy, etc.</li>
      <li>Fix all the bugs and edits suggested by my testers, which mostly means making my name on the galleries a link, making my contact info more smoothly integrated and visible, creating a link between the video on the home page and the page for that video, and re-designing my About page to be more cohesive.</li>
      <li>My new KPI is to have visitors visit all four tabs of the site and click on at least one project.</li>
