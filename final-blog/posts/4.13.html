<h3 id="post-title">Prioritizing</h3>
<p id="body-text">Since Tuesday, progress has been slow. I've been focusing on getting my sketches into code, but I'm realizing I have more learning to do on the technical side than I thought, and finding myself easily frustrated.</p>

<p id="body-text">Now I'm basically making a list of challenges so I know where to focus my time and tackle all the tricky stuff while I have the resources to help me. The first and maybe most minor issue is my attempt to have a circle appear over menu items on hover. As it is, you can either click the link or hover to see the circle, but both won't happen at the same time!</p>

<p id="body-text">Also on the to-conquer list:
<ul>
<li>Galleries! I really want to use Owl Carousel (the plug-in) to make my galleries smooth and responsive, but I'm struggling so hard to implement it given my limited knowledge of jQuery.</li>
<li>Responsivity in general: as it is, there's some funkiness that happens between the desktop viewport size and the break for mobile. Ugh.</li>
Animations, transitions, and user testing (maybe not in that order) are next. So much to do!
