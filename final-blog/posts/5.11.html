<h3 id="post-title">Mouseflow and Final Feedback</h3>
<p id="body-text">To finish up this documentation, I have some results from Mouseflow on reaching my KPI of visitors clicking on every link of the site and at least one piece page, and some feedback from a professional in the industry.</p>

<h2>KPI</h2>
  <p id="body-text">Mouseflow is a really interesting tool, and I'm glad I finally ended up using it, because I learned some interesting things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Not counting myself, 12 people visited my site (I referred five people to go see it).</li>
    <li>Three of them found it from a Google search for my name (kinda creepy but I'll take it)</li>
    <li>Almost every single person navigated my site from left to right at the top: home, then art, then design, then about. AND excitingly, 10 out of the 12 people visited every tab! Hurray!</li>
    <li>People spent the most time on the Art and Home pages.</li>
    <li>People tried to click on the video background on the home page, which is a good hint that I should make that a link to the video's page.</li>
    <li>The top visited piece pages were my Jimi Hendrix Un-Illustrated project, Boxed Up, and the drawing tool video.</li>
    <li>No one contacted me, but I honestly didn't expect them to if they're just passing by.</li>
    <p id="body-text">The heat maps and click habits really gave me an insight into what I'm doing right (having my name be a link back to home) and what I should improve in the future (having the background video be a link to its page). Overall, my KPI was met and I'm happy!</p>

<h2>Interview with Mel Erbacher</h2>
<p id="body text">I had the chance to meet up with Mel Erbacher, a graphic designer working in marketing and visual merchandizing for the clothing company I work for (Free People), who was in town to visit the NY locations of the store from the headquarters of the brand in Philadelphia. This was an exciting chance for me because right now, I can see myself working in this company in a creative capacity in the future.</p>

<p id="body-text">Maybe one of my biggest takeaways from this interaction right off the bat was learning how not to do an interview. I had a totally lovely chat with Mel about my work and my site, guided by some questions I'd written before, but somehow convinced myself the whole time it was more important to be in the moment and polite than it was to record what was happening (I told myself I'd remember!). Next time, I think I would ask them if they were open with being audio recorded, so I could just have that going and focus on talking. As it is, I just have some takeaway notes from our conversation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Her background is in branding, so she had a lot of advice on branding myself on the site. Her sense was that I wasn't committing entirely to one aesthetic, and instead I should decide what my look is and really go for it to get out of a neutral halfway zone where a lot of other designers hang out.</li>
  <li>On professionalism, she advised including a copyright footer with my contact info to look cleaner.</li>
  <li>She actually liked the home page logo of my old site better, because she said the type busting out of the circle seemed more dynamic and really highlighted the groovy typeface.</li>
  <li>She wondered how I could incorporate more color and get away from so much white space, which she felt is too common of a convention now.</li>

<p id="body-text">It was really cool to hear feedback from somone working in a position I might like to have one day, but it also ultimately felt like getting feedback from anyone else, where I still have to filter their comments into yes, that aligns with my vision and will improve my project, and no, that's just not what I was thinking for this at all, so now it's clear I should strengthen my initial vision.</p>
<p id="body-text">Overall, I'm content with where my site is, how it looks, and the fact that I coded it myself. I have a few thoughts of directions I might take it in the future to really push it and make it more noteworthy, but for now, I'm so excited to have a functional, clean, easy to navigate site.</p>
