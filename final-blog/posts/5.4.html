<h3 id="post-title">Mobile</h3>
<p id="body-text">Finally, mobile!</p>
<p id="body-text">My main goal here was to maintain as much of the desktop version as possible, while simplifying and streamlining for mobile. Essentially, this meant taking out hover states, arranging captions under images instead of on top of them, and narrowing grids down to single columns to make it easy to scroll through nice big pictures without having to do any more tapping or zooming.</p>

<p id="body-text">The top menu got scaled up and brought tighter together to make it finger-tapping friendly (I'm so glas I didn't need a hamburger menu, because I think this top menu really ties in the mobile version with the desktop version).</p>

<p id="body-text">For individual piece pages, I brought the description text and title to the top, followed by all the nice big images. I debated for a while on this order (should it be images and then text?), but ultimately decided people would be more likely to read the text if it's at the top, and even if you're going to skip it and go straight to the images, you at least know it's there and can come back up and reference it if you want.</p>

<p id="body-text">The About page still needs a facelift, and I'm in the process of sketching for that (both mobile and desktop). But that's for another post.</p>

<p id="body-text">Clearly, a loose end I need to tie up is my email in the bottom right corner; it looks odd on deskptop and especially weird on mobile! I'll probably try to transform that into a cleaner fixed footer with copyright information alongside.</p>
