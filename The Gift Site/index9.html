    <p>Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label. "Ah, god,
it's from Waldo!"</p>
<p> "That schmuck!" said Sheila. Waldo trembled with expectation.</p>
<p>
"Well, you might as well open it, " said Sheila.</p>

  <p>Both of them tried to lift the
staple flap. "Ah sst, " said Marsha, groaning, "he must have nailed it shut."</p>
</div>
<div id="story2">
  <p>
They tugged on the flap again. "My God, you need a power drill to get this
thing open!" They pulled again. "You can't get a grip." They both stood still,
breathing heavily.</p>
<p>
"Why don't you get a scissor, " said Sheila. </p>
<p>Marsha ran into the kitchen, but
all she could find was a little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
father kept a collection of tools in the basement. She ran downstairs, and when
she came back up, she had a large sheet metal cutter
in her hand.
