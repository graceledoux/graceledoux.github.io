<div class="story">
    <p id="p1">Sheila Klein, her very, very best friend, walked in through the porch screen
door and into the kitchen. "Oh gawd, it's absolutely maudlin outside." </p>
<p id="p2">"Ach, I
know what you mean, I feel all icky!" Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton
robe with the silk outer edge.</p>
<p id="p3"> Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on
the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face. "I'm supposed to be
taking these salt pills, but, " she wrinkled her nose, "they make me feel like
throwing up."</p>

<p id="p5"> Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an exercise she'd
seen on television. "God, don't even talk about that." </p>
<p id="p6">She got up from the
table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue
vitamins. "Want one? Supposed to be better than steak, " and then attempted to
touch her knees. "I don't think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again."
