  <p>Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit. </p>

  <p>It was now Mid-August which meant he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months. Two months, and all he had
to show was three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone
calls. True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin, and he to
Locust, Pennsylvania, she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity. She would
date occasionally, but merely as amusement.

<p>She would remain faithful.</p>
