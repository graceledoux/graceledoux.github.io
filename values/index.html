    <p id="button">My Skills</p><p id="lil-text">I’m good at communicating with others, both about my own and their needsand wants. I’m a decent designer (still very much learning!), which I think comes down to my ability to envision something and then problem solve and nit-pick until my vision is realized. I’m not encumbered by road blocks, and I think there’s a lot of magic in details.</p>

    <p id="button">My Profitable Plan</p><p id="lil-text">I think being paid to do something creative is an enormous display of trust on the client’s part, and I do my best to honor that. In my experience, being warm and friendly and extremely open and communicative with clients leads to them telling their friends or coming back to me for other projects. </p>
