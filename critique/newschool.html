    <h2>The New School</h2>
    <h3>Our school's official site.</h3>
    <p>I'll be honest, my main gripe with this site design-wise is the typography! Our school's entire branding is based around this awkward typeface featured heavily here. For one of the best graphic design schools in the world, it seems strange.</p><p> As far as functionality, this site is clearly not for current students at all, as it only offers information on a surface, prospective student level, and if you try to dig deeper to find real info (such as tuition!), you're linked out to the older, uglier version of the site. </p>
