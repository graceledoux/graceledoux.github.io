      Project: Using only hot glue and 1/4" foamcore, design a set of imaginative stairs.

</p>
<p>
  This project was all about testing materiality. Foamcore is flimsy, easily bend and broken, and very difficult to cut cleanly without creating foam crumbs. I wanted to push the limits of this material by creating a set of stairs that centered around triangular forms and balanced on tiny points. It took many iterations to reach the final product!</p>
